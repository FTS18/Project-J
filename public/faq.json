    "question": "What is Project J?",
    "answer": "This tool serves as a JEE Mains College Predictor, assisting you in exploring potential engineering college admissions based on your JEE Main performance (rank or percentile). It factors in your category, gender, home state, and institute preferences to generate estimated predictions, drawing upon <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 data."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the results guaranteed?",
    "answer": "No, the predictions offered by this tool are based on historical <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 data and serve as estimations for admissions through the joint process. Actual cutoff ranks can vary annually. Hence, the results are indicative, not a guarantee of admission. Always consult the official <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> website for definitive information."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the data for these predictions come from?",
    "answer": "The predictions are generated by comparing your input against past years' cutoff ranks for various engineering colleges, specifically focusing on the Round 5 data released by the <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> (Joint Seat Allocation Authority) for IITs, NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs. The aim is to identify potential college and branch fits based on historical trends within this allocation system."

  {
    "question": "What data from other counselling processes is NOT included in Project J?",
    "answer": "The current database solely comprises data from the Joint Seat Allocation Authority. Information from other counselling bodies like CSAB, JAC Delhi, AKTU, MHT CET, COMEDK, and similar platforms is not part of this predictor's scope."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does Project J include data from CSAB?",
    "answer": "No, this tool utilizes data specifically from <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 of 2024. Data from CSAB, which handles post-JoSAA vacant seat allocation, isn't included."

  {
    "question": "How can I contact the developer for feedback or issues?",
    "answer": "You can reach me at <a href=\"mailto:spacify1807@gmail.com\">spacify1807@gmail.com</a> for feedback or to report any issues."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between CRL and Category Rank?",
    "answer": "CRL (Common Rank List) is your overall JEE Mains rank. Category Rank is your rank within your specific category (EWS, OBC-NCL, SC, ST), used for reserved category admissions in JoSAA counselling."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are IITs not included in the predictions?",
    "answer": "This predictor currently focuses on NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs based on <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 data. IIT admissions follow different patterns and aren't part of the current model."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often is the data updated?",
    "answer": "The underlying data is typically updated after the conclusion of the joint seat allocation each year. Currently, it uses <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 data. Efforts will be made to incorporate the latest available information."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use this predictor for state-level college admissions?",
    "answer": "Presently, the focus is primarily on <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> counselling data. While it might offer a general perspective, it's not optimized for state-level admissions. Consult the respective state counselling authorities for their specific details."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors can affect the accuracy of the predictions?",
    "answer": "Prediction accuracy can be influenced by several variables, including changes in seat availability, JEE Main exam difficulty variations, shifts in student preferences, and modifications in the <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> counselling process. Therefore, the results should be seen as indicative."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many rounds of counselling are typically conducted by JoSAA?",
    "answer": "The joint seat allocation usually involves 5 to 6 rounds. The exact number can vary annually. The data within this predictor is based on Round 5 of the 2024 process."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I find the official data for cutoff ranks?",
    "answer": "Official cutoff ranks are available on the official <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/\">JoSAA</a> website."
