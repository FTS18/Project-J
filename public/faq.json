    "question": "What is Project J?",
    "answer": "It is a JEE Mains College Predictor designed to help you explore potential engineering college admissions based on your rank or percentile in the JEE Mains examination. The predictor considers various factors like your category, gender, home state, and preferred institute types to provide estimated predictions based on <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I use the rank and percentile inputs?",
    "answer": "You can enter your JEE Mains Common Rank List (CRL) or Category Rank in the 'CRL/Category Rank' field OR your percentile in the 'or Percentile' field. The tool will use whichever value you provide to make predictions. You don't need to fill both. **Please note that Category options are only applicable when you enter a Category Rank in the 'CRL/Category Rank' field. If you enter a percentile, Category selection will not influence the prediction.** Keep in mind that the current predictions are based solely on JoSAA data."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does selecting a Category (EWS, OBC-NCL, SC, ST, OPEN) affect the results?",
    "answer": "Your category plays a significant role in JEE Main admissions as there are category-wise reservations and different cutoff ranks for each category within JoSAA counselling. By selecting your applicable category, it can use the relevant historical cutoff data from <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 for a more personalized prediction. **However, Category selection is only effective if you provide a Category Rank in the 'CRL/Category Rank' field. If you provide a percentile, the predictions are based on the overall percentile, and Category is not considered.**"
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I use the Specific City/Branch search bar?",
    "answer": "This search bar enables you to further refine your search results within the colleges participating in JoSAA counselling. You can type in a specific city (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai) or a particular branch of engineering (e.g., Computer Science, Electrical Engineering) to see if any predicted colleges from the <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 data match your criteria. These search results do not include data from other counselling platforms at this time."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens when I click the Continue button?",
    "answer": "Upon clicking Continue, the information you've entered (rank/percentile, home state, gender, category (if applicable), selected institute types, and search query) is processed. The system then analyzes this data against a comprehensive database of <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 cutoff ranks for various colleges and branches. Based on this analysis, it generates a list of potential colleges and branches that align with your profile within the JoSAA framework. Predictions for other counselling processes are not yet available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do Low, Medium, and High probabilities indicate?",
    "answer": "After you enter your rank/percentile, the predicted colleges might be tagged with Low, Medium, or High probability. This is an estimation of your chances of getting admission into that particular college and branch based on how your rank compares to the <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 cutoff ranks. High suggests a strong possibility within JoSAA counselling, Medium indicates a reasonable chance, and Low means the cutoff ranks were close to or slightly better than your rank, so the chances are less certain within the JoSAA context. Other counselling processes are not considered in these probabilities."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are the results guaranteed?",
    "answer": "No, the predictions provided by it are based on historical <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024 data and are intended as estimations for admissions through JoSAA. Actual cutoff ranks for the current academic year can vary due to factors like the number of applicants, the difficulty level of the exam, and changes in the admission policies within the counselling authority. Therefore, the results should be considered as indicative and not a guarantee of admission through JoSAA or any other counselling. Always refer to the official <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> website for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding JoSAA counselling."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the data for these predictions come from?",
    "answer": "The predictions are generated by comparing your input data against a database of past years' cutoff ranks for various engineering colleges, specifically focusing on the Round 5 data released by the <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> (Joint Seat Allocation Authority) for IITs, NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs. It aims to identify colleges and branches where your rank falls within or close to the historical cutoff ranges from <a href=\"https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/SeatAllotmentResult/CurrentORCR.aspx\">JoSAA</a> Round 5 2024."

We will strive to update the data with the latest available information."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use this predictor for state-level college admissions?",
    "answer": "Currently, it primarily focuses on JoSAA counselling data. While it might give you a general idea, it's not designed for accurate predictions for state-level college admissions. You should refer to the respective state counselling authorities for their specific cutoff details."
  },
  {
    "question": "What factors can affect the accuracy of the predictions?",
    "answer": "Several factors can influence the accuracy, including: \n    -   Changes in the number of seats available.\n    -   Variations in the difficulty level of the JEE Mains exam each year.\n    -   Shifts in student preferences for colleges and branches.\n    -   Changes in the JoSAA counselling process.\n    Therefore, the predictions it provides are indicative and not definitive."
